# go-studies

## Overview
This repository, `go-studies`, is dedicated solely to my personal learning and exploration of the Go programming language (often referred to as Golang). Here, you'll find various examples, exercises, and small projects that I've undertaken to better understand Go's syntax, features, and best practices.
